        <p style="font-size: larger;" class="text-center bg-info"><b>Cricket is an outdoor game that is played using a bat and ball. It is a famous game in India.
            Cricket matches are played on a field with a rectangular pitch in the centre. This pitch is 22 yards long. Wickets are placed on the ends of the pitch.
            The game involves two teams, each of which gets a chance to bat and bowl. Each unit has 11 players.
            The captains do a coin toss, and the captain that wins gets to decide whether to bat or bowl.
            Two batsmen are allowed on the pitch and must score runs. The bowling team tries to get wickets to prevent this. A batsman can score six runs in one ball, and one over lasts six balls.
            The first team to bat sets the target score. The opposing team must chase this score. If they do, they win.
            Umpires ensure that teams follow the rules. There are two umpires on the field, near the bowler’s end and on leg square. There is another umpire off-field and a match referee.
            Cricket has three formats – T20, ODI and test matches. T20 is played for 20 overs, ODI for 50 overs and the test is played for five days, at least 90 overs per day.
            Cricket was started in the 16th century England. It is played in countries like India, England, Australia, South Africa, etc. ICC is the regulatory body.
            Cricket is a popular game. Children play cricket on the streets and open grounds. When cricket matches happen, the stadiums are filled with enthusiastic fans, and they cheer loud for their teams, which encourages the players. Many families sit in front of the TV and watch the whole game with many emotions and cheers.</b></p>
